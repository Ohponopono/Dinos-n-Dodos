Paleontology Revamp
  • Fossils are uncovered by mining sand with Brushes while Frozen Meat is uncovered by mining ice with Chisels.
  • There are now only 5 levels of accuracy, instead of the 10 they had prior.
      ○ Combining accuracy levels is now similar to Enchanted Books. Two Accuracy I's will add to a Accuracy II, but an Accuracy I combined with an Accuracy II would only create an Accuracy II.
      ○ As for fossils, corresponding to their level in order of lowest to highest the new names are as follows: Shattered Fossil, Eroded Fossil, Fractured Fossil, Cracked Fossil and the Pristine Fossil.
      ○ As for frozen meats, corresponding to their level in order of lowest to highest the new names are as follows: Spoiled Frozen Meat, Rotted Frozen Meat, Tainted Frozen Meat, Decaying Frozen Meat and Pristine Frozen Meat.
      ○ Like before, for both fossils and frozen meats, the highest level of accuracy always has a custom texture corresponding to the animal of the fossil.
  • Using items with the Fossil Preservation attribute can increase your chance of extracting fossils and frozen meats with higher levels of accuracy.
  • Using more oxidized brushes can also increase the chance of fossils themselves dropping from sand when mined, however this also decreases the chance of treasure items dropping.

Paleontology Table
  • A new crafting station that works similarly to the crafting table. All Dinos & Dodos items are now crafted in this block.

Paleontologist
  • The Paleontologist is a new villager profession that uses the Paleontology Table as their workstation block.
  • Paleontologists sell a variety of paleontological items, including fossils of varying accuracies.

Genetic Extractor
  • The Genetic Extractor takes on the use of the Analyzer and DNA Extractor.
      ○ Inserting genetic material and a paper will output a Genetic Note.
      ○ Inserting genetic material and a bottle will output DNA.

Genome Modifier
  • The Genome modifier now takes on the use of the DNA Combinator alongside its old use.
      ○ Inserting two DNA will no longer modify the genome of the bottom DNA, instead to modify an organisms genome use Genetic Notes.

Upgrade Cartridges
  • Upgrade Cartridges are a new item crafted in the Paleontology Table which allow you to upgrade other crafting stations.
      ○ Genetic Extractors become
      ○ Genome Modifiers become the Genetic Decoder
      ○ Cultivators become the Vat
