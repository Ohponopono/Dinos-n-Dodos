Needle
  • Can be crafted and then used to extract the DNA of any mobs.
  • Hitting a mob with a needle will extract its DNA, copying over any special NBT like names, attributes, and drop chances.

Fossils
  • Fossils now have varying accuracy that goes by multiples of 10, with 10 being the minimum and 100 being the maximum.
  • Fossils with 100 accuracy have custom textures that correspond to their animal.
  • Fossils can uncommonly be fished up.

Sifter
  • The Sifter now outputs lots of new items.
        ○ Among these new items are Petrified Logs and Amber.

Analyzer
  • A new vital machine in the process of bringing back dinosaurs.
  • Input a fossil and a piece of paper and it outputs a Genetic Note.
        ○ Genetic Notes function identically to paper and thus can be used as input in the Analyzer again.

DNA Extractor
  • Used to extract DNA from any organic plant material or from any needle.
  • Any and all organic plant material can be input into the DNA Extractor for the plants DNA.
  • Any needle with DNA inside of it can be input into the DNA Extractor for the needles DNA.

Genome Modifier
  • Used to modify the genomes of entities.
  • Inputting a structural note alongside similar enough DNA and it will modify the DNA to match the structure on the note.
  • Input two similar DNA and it will modify the genomes of the DNA on the bottom slot.
        ○ The genome of a entity is identical to its attributes.
        ○ The Genome Modifier halves the genome of the top DNA and adds it to the genome of the bottom DNA.

DNA Combinator
  • Used to combine two pieces of DNA.
  • Inputting two of the same DNA with different accuracy will add their accuracy together.
        ○ Accuracies must be below 100 in order for them to be added. If the two accuracies create a accuracy of more than 100 it will still output a DNA with 100 accuracy.
  • Inputting two DNA with similar identifiers and 100 accuracy will create a hybrid.
        ○ No hybrids exist as of this update and thus inserting the DNA will output a incompatible hybrid.

Cultivator
  • Used to cultivate DNA into embryos.
  • Input a DNA into the top slot and a bucket of nutritious milk for the egg or embryo of a mob.
        ○ Different mobs output different types of eggs and embryos.

Projector
  • Used to create a holographic display of custom entities.
  • Inputting the genetic material of any [custom] entity into the Projector will create a holographic display of the entity.
  • Certain blocks placed below the projector affect it differently.
        ○ Placing a glass below the Projector will remove the blue tint from the Projection.
        ○ Placing a concrete below the Projector will animate the Projection with a walking cycle.
        ○ Placing a wool below the Projector will change the Projection to a baby model. (If the projection has a baby model.)
        ○ Placing a glazed terracotta below the Projector will change the direction the Projection is facing.
  • Eggs can also be inserted into a projector, creating a projection of them. (This may be changed in a later update.)

Dinosaur Eggs
  • Complete revamp to the way dinosaur eggs hatch.
        ○ Different dinosaur eggs hatch at different times of the day.
        ○ 'Warm' blocks can be placed around dinosaur eggs to speed up their hatching.
        ○ Hay Bales can also be placed beneath eggs to speed up their hatching.
  • Only one egg can be in a single block at any time now.
  • Breaking an egg will not drop its item. (This may be changed in a later update.)

Baby Dinosaurs
  • Different baby dinosaurs now eat different items to speed up their growth, not just honey.

Petrified Log
  • A new decorative block dropped through sifting and fishing.
  • Will eventually be used to extract the structure of ancient trees.

Amber
  • A new item dropped through sifting and fishing.
  • Can be used to extract the structure of insects.

Amber Blocks
  • A new decorative block dropped through fishing.
  • When broken it drops a varying amount of Amber.
        ○ If broken with silk touch it drops itself.

Budding Amber
  • A new block dropped very rarely through fishing.
  • When broken it shatters, dropping a piece of Amber.
  • Budding Amber may grow an Amber Block every so often on its top or bottom.

Config
  • doFossilAccuracy
        ○ Determines if fossils have accuracy or should always have 100 accuracy.
  • doGeneticMods
        ○ Determines if the Genome Modifier can modify genomes.
  • doHybridization
        ○ Determines if the DNA Combinator can create hybrids.
