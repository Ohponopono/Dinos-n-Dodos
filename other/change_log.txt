Paleontology Revamp
  • Fossils are uncovered by mining sand with Brushes while Frozen Meat is uncovered by mining ice with Chisels.
  • There are now only 5 levels of accuracy, instead of the 10 they had prior.
      ○ Combining accuracy levels is now similar to Enchanted Books. Two Accuracy I's will add to a Accuracy II, but an Accuracy I combined with an Accuracy II would only create an Accuracy II.
      ○ As for fossils, corresponding to their level in order of lowest to highest the new names are as follows: Shattered Fossil, Eroded Fossil, Fractured Fossil, Cracked Fossil, and the Pristine Fossil.
      ○ As for frozen meats, corresponding to their level in order of lowest to highest the new names are as follows: Spoiled Frozen Meat, Rotted Frozen Meat, Tainted Frozen Meat, Decaying Frozen Meat and Pristine Frozen Meat.
      ○ Like before, for both fossils and frozen meats, the highest level of accuracy always has a custom texture corresponding to the animal of the fossil.
  • Using items with the Fossil Preservation attribute can increase your chance of extracting fossils and frozen meats with higher levels of accuracy.
  • Using more oxidized brushes can also increase the chance of fossils themselves dropping from sand when mined, however this also decreases the chance of treasure items dropping.

Paleontology Table
  • A new crafting station that works similarly to the crafting table. All Dinos & Dodos items are now crafted in this block.

Paleontologist
  • The Paleontologist is a new villager profession that uses the Paleontology Table as their workstation block.
  • Paleontologists sell a variety of paleontological items, including fossils of varying accuracies.

Extractor
  • The old DNA Extractor has been renamed to the Extractor.
      ○ Has practically the same functionality of the old Extractor.
      ○ Inserting structural material (fossil or frozen meat) of less than 5 accuracy and a paper will output a Genetic Note.
      ○ Inserting structural material (fossil or frozen meat) of 5 accuracy and a paper will output a Genetic Schematic.
      ○ Inserting genetic material (plants or needle) and a bottle will output DNA.

Modifier
  • The old Genome Modifier has been renamed the Modifier.
      ○ Inserting two DNA will no longer modify the genome of the bottom DNA, instead it will modify the genome of the top DNA.
      ○ Inserting two of the same Genetic Notes will add them together like enchanted books in an anvil.
      ○ If two Accuracy IV Genetic Notes are added together, they will create a Genetic Schematic.
      ○ A Genetic Schematic with a DNA of the same identifier will create a DNA of the animal on the Genetic Schematic.

Fossil Stand
  • Surrounding a Fossil or Frozen Meat with sticks in a Paleontology Table crafts the Fossil Stand.
      ○ The Fossil stand is used to display fossils. Fossils of different Accuracies display different models on the stand.
      ○ Once placed simply hit the stand to pick it back up.
      ○ Stands do not obey the laws of gravity because they do not care what you think. Hang your fossils from the ceiling!
